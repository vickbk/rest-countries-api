### What I learned

In this section I reviewed the routing concept I was learning in this learning path.
I enjoyed using the nextjs routing system for this project.

### Continued development

After this project, I will continue to read best practices for framework usage, I also didn't implement unit testing for separate components which will be my focus from now on.
